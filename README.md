A repository of programs for interactively exploring methods in computer graphics and their underlying math.

## Collection 1: Bezier Curves

Inspired by Freya Holmer's YouTube video(s) explaining [Bezier Curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds)

Current Programs:
- **BezierCreator**: Allows the user to create, move, and delete points which can be connected into cubic Bezier Curves. Provides options to display the lower-order reference lines that define the cubic curve, as well as the curve parameter.
- **DerivativeExplorer (WIP)**: Allows the user to adjust a cubic Bezier curve while simultaneously displaying position, velocity, and acceleration plots that update as the curve is adjusted.

Planned Programs:
- **CurveRider**: Allows the user to experiment with animation speeds along a Bezier Curve. Provides an option to switch between curve parameterization and arclength parameterization.
